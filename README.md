# Phase-3
The Tyler-Veseth file is the same from phase 2 and has all of the scrips needed to populate the database.
The php scripts are fairly simply. You only need to enter the id of any character and all of the scripts will run and return different information on that caracter depending on the script.
The triggers I made were to help clean up my database if a character was deleted. In the event that a character is deleted, all of its items will be removed including the weapons and armor. Then, the characters association to their party will be removed.
